# Abstract Methods and Classes

An *abstract class* is a class that is declared `abstract`â€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

An *abstract method* is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:

```java
abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);
```

If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself *must* be declared `abstract`, as in:

```java
public abstract class GraphicObject {
   // declare fields
   // declare nonabstract methods
   abstract void draw();
}
```

<u>When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared `abstract`.</u>

**Note:** Methods in an *interface* (see the [Interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html) section) that are not declared as default or static are *implicitly* abstract, so the `abstract` modifier is not used with interface methods. (It can be used, but it is unnecessary.)

## Abstract Classes Compared to Interfaces

Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with ***abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods. With interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces.***

Which should you use, abstract classes or interfaces?

- Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:
  - You want to share code among several closely related classes.
  - You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).
  - You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.
- Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:
  - You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces [`Comparable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html) and [`Cloneable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html) are implemented by many unrelated classes.
  - You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.
  - You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.

An example of an abstract class in the JDK is [`AbstractMap`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractMap.html), which is part of the Collections Framework. Its subclasses (which include `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`) share many methods (including `get`, `put`, `isEmpty`, `containsKey`, and `containsValue`) that `AbstractMap` defines.

An example of a class in the JDK that implements several interfaces is [`HashMap`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html), which implements the interfaces `Serializable`, `Cloneable`, and `Map<K, V>`. By reading this list of interfaces, you can infer that an instance of `HashMap` (regardless of the developer or company who implemented the class) can be cloned, is serializable (which means that it can be converted into a byte stream; see the section [Serializable Objects](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html)), and has the functionality of a map. In addition, the `Map<K, V>` interface has been enhanced with many default methods such as `merge` and `forEach` that older classes that have implemented this interface do not have to define.

Note that many software libraries use both abstract classes and interfaces; the `HashMap` class implements several interfaces and also extends the abstract class `AbstractMap`.

## An Abstract Class Example

In an object-oriented drawing application, you can draw circles, rectangles, lines, Bezier curves, and many other graphic objects. These objects all have certain states (for example: position, orientation, line color, fill color) and behaviors (for example: moveTo, rotate, resize, draw) in common. Some of these states and behaviors are the same for all graphic objects (for example: position, fill color, and moveTo). Others require different implementations (for example, resize or draw). All `GraphicObject`s must be able to draw or resize themselves; they just differ in how they do it. This is a perfect situation for an abstract superclass. You can take advantage of the similarities and declare all the graphic objects to inherit from the same abstract parent object (for example, `GraphicObject`) as shown in the following figure.

![Classes Rectangle, Line, Bezier, and Circle Inherit from GraphicObject ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/java/classes-graphicObject.gif)



Classes Rectangle, Line, Bezier, and Circle Inherit from GraphicObject

First, you declare an abstract class, `GraphicObject`, to provide member variables and methods that are wholly shared by all subclasses, such as the current position and the `moveTo` method. `GraphicObject` also declares abstract methods for methods, such as `draw` or `resize`, that need to be implemented by all subclasses but must be implemented in different ways. The `GraphicObject` class can look something like this:

```java
abstract class GraphicObject {
    int x, y;
    ...
    void moveTo(int newX, int newY) {
        ...
    }
    abstract void draw();
    abstract void resize();
}
```

Each nonabstract subclass of `GraphicObject`, such as `Circle` and `Rectangle`, must provide implementations for the `draw` and `resize` methods:

```java
class Circle extends GraphicObject {
    void draw() {
        ...
    }
    void resize() {
        ...
    }
}
class Rectangle extends GraphicObject {
    void draw() {
        ...
    }
    void resize() {
        ...
    }
}
```

## When an Abstract Class Implements an Interface

In the section on [`Interfaces`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html), it was noted that a class that implements an interface must implement *all* of the interface's methods. It is possible, however, to define a class that does not implement all of the interface's methods, provided that the class is declared to be `abstract`. For example,

```java
abstract class X implements Y {
  // implements all but one method of Y
}

class XX extends X {
  // implements the remaining method in Y
}
```

In this case, class `X` must be `abstract` because it does not fully implement `Y`, but class `XX` does, in fact, implement `Y`.

## Class Members

An abstract class may have `static` fields and `static` methods. You can use these static members with a class reference (for example, `AbstractClass.staticMethod()`) as you would with any other class.





## Interface Vs. Abstract Class

An abstract class permits you to make functionality that subclasses can implement or override whereas an interface only permits you to state functionality but not to implement it. A class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces.

| **Parameters**               | **Interface**                                                | **Abstract class**                                           |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed                        | Slow                                                         | Fast                                                         |
| Multiple Inheritances        | Implement several Interfaces                                 | Only one abstract class                                      |
| Structure                    | Abstract methods                                             | Abstract & concrete methods                                  |
| When to use                  | Future enhancement                                           | To avoid independence                                        |
| Inheritance/ Implementation  | A Class can implement multiple interfaces                    | The class can inherit only one Abstract Class                |
| Default Implementation       | While adding new stuff to the interface, it is a nightmare to find all the implementors and implement newly defined stuff. | In case of Abstract Class, you can take advantage of the default implementation. |
| Access Modifiers             | The interface does not have access modifiers. Everything defined inside the interface is assumed public modifier. | Abstract Class can have an access modifier.                  |
| When to use                  | It is better to use interface when various implementations share only method signature. Polymorphic hierarchy of value types. | It should be used when various implementations of the same kind share a common behavior. |
| Data fields                  | the interface cannot contain data fields.                    | the class can have data fields.                              |
| Multiple Inheritance Default | A class may implement numerous interfaces.                   | A class inherits only one abstract class.                    |
| Implementation               | An interface is abstract so that it can't provide any code.  | An abstract class can give complete, default code which should be overridden. |
| Use of Access modifiers      | You cannot use access modifiers for the method, properties, etc. | You can use an abstract class which contains access modifiers. |
| Usage                        | Interfaces help to define the peripheral abilities of a class. | An abstract class defines the identity of a class.           |
| Defined fields               | No fields can be defined                                     | An abstract class allows you to define both fields and constants |
| Inheritance                  | An interface can inherit multiple interfaces but cannot inherit a class. | An abstract class can inherit a class and multiple interfaces. |
| Constructor or destructors   | An interface cannot declare constructors or destructors.     | An abstract class can declare constructors and destructors.  |
| Limit of Extensions          | It can extend any number of interfaces.                      | It can extend only one class or one abstract class at a time. |
| Abstract keyword             | In an abstract interface keyword, is optional for declaring a method as an abstract. | In an abstract class, the abstract keyword is compulsory for declaring a method as an abstract. |
| Class type                   | An interface can have only public abstract methods.          | An abstract class has protected and public abstract methods. |

## Sample code for Interface and Abstract Class in Java

Following is sample code to create an interface and abstract class in Java

**Interface Syntax**

```java
interface name{
//methods
}
```

**Java Interface Example:**

```java
interface Pet {
    public void test();
}
class Dog implements Pet {
    public void test() {
        System.out.println("Interface Method Implemented");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Pet p = new Dog();
        p.test();
    }
}
```

**Abstract Class Syntax**

```java
abstract class name{
    // code
}
```

**Abstract class example:**

```java
abstract class Shape {
    int b = 20;
    abstract public void calculateArea();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Rectangle obj = new Rectangle();
        obj.b = 200;
        obj.calculateArea();
    }
    public void calculateArea() {
        System.out.println("Area is " + (obj.b * obj.b));
    }
}
```
