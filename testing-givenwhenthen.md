# [GivenWhenThen](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html)

Given-When-Then is a style of representing tests - or as its advocates would say - specifying a system's behavior using [SpecificationByExample](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html). It's an approach developed by [Daniel Terhorst-North](http://dannorth.net/about/) and Chris Matts as part of [Behavior-Driven Development](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/) (BDD). [[1\]](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html#footnote-ivan) It appears as a structuring approach for many testing frameworks such as Cucumber. You can also look at it as a reformulation of the [Four-Phase Test](http://xunitpatterns.com/Four Phase Test.html) pattern.

The essential idea is to break down writing a scenario (or test) into three sections:

- The **given** part describes the state of the world before you begin the behavior you're specifying in this scenario. You can think of it as the pre-conditions to the test.
- The **when** section is that behavior that you're specifying.
- Finally the **then** section describes the changes you expect due to the specified behavior.

Since we're talking about using examples as specifications, it makes sense to show this with an example [[2\]](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html#footnote-example-credit)

```
Feature: User trades stocks
  Scenario: User requests a sell before close of trading
    Given I have 100 shares of MSFT stock
       And I have 150 shares of APPL stock
       And the time is before close of trading

    When I ask to sell 20 shares of MSFT stock
     
     Then I should have 80 shares of MSFT stock
      And I should have 150 shares of APPL stock
      And a sell order for 20 shares of MSFT stock should have been executed
  
```

The above example uses Cucumber [[3\]](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html#footnote-gherkin), which a popular way of writing [BusinessFacingTests](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessFacingTest.html) but you can use the Given-When-Then style with any kind of tests. Some people like to put Given-When-Then as comments to mark informal blocks inside unit tests [[4\]](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html#footnote-frameworks). I've also seen this convention to structure informal prose.

It's usual with this approach to see "ands" used to combine multiple expressions within each clause.

I've characterized the given as a description of the pre-condition state because that's the way I prefer to think of it. A testing framework, however, interprets the givens as a set of commands to bring the system-under-test into the correct state before executing the when command. (Which is why other naming conventions often call this "setup".) Testing frameworks provide various query methods for the then commands - these should be free of side-effects.

Although Given-When-Then style is symptomatic to BDD, the basic idea is pretty common when writing tests or specification by example. [Meszaros](https://martinfowler.com/books/xunit) describes the pattern as [Four-Phase Test](http://xunitpatterns.com/Four Phase Test.html). His four phases are Setup (Given), Exercise (When), Verify (Then) and Teardown [[5\]](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html#footnote-teardown). Bill Wake came up with the formulation as [Arrange, Act, Assert](http://xp123.com/articles/3a-arrange-act-assert/).

## Notes

**1:** In review comments on this, Dan credits Ivan Moore for a significant amount of inspiration in coming up with this.

**2:** from [Pete Hodgson](http://blog.thepete.net/)

**3:** Or to be strict it uses Gherkin, which is the name of Cucumber's DSL.

**4:** Test frameworks tend to follow either naming style of xunit or BDD, the latter tend to name methods in the Given-When-Then style.

**5:** Teardown isn't always needed when implementing tests (particularly if you are using [Automated Teardown](http://xunitpatterns.com/Automated Teardown.html)) and doesn't add much to the communication aspect of specification by example. So it's reasonable to see it missing from the BDD style.
