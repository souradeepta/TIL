## 3 Sample Emails to a Recruiter

Make your email message as customized as possible. (Whatever you do, avoid spamming recruiters with a stock copy/paste message. They’re easy to spot and even easier to ignore.) Use these sample emails for inspiration.

**Connecting With a Recruiter**

Subject: Any content marketing roles at XYZ?



Hi Francois,

I read the *Inc.* article last week about XYZ Inc.’s rapid growth since landing five million in venture capital last spring. Way to rock that funding! Do you have plans to expand your marketing department?

I’ve had great success as the brand manager for Acme Widgets for the past five years. I’m planning to move into a broader content marketing role that challenges me to grow as a brand storyteller, and XYZ has been on my radar. I’d love to chat with you for 5-10 minutes to introduce myself and learn more about the company’s culture and any upcoming roles you need to fill. Would you have time for a quick phone call on Wednesday?

All the best,

Marla Dixon



**The Follow-up Email**

Subject: Lead copywriting role at Acme – Résumé attached

Hi Emily,

I applied for the lead copywriting role at Acme Widgets last week. I’m impressed by Acme’s crazy fast growth in the widget industry, and I’m excited by the opportunity to be part of a lively team.

I think I’m a great fit for this position because my ten years in the copywriting trenches has made me a whiz at turning out clean, compelling copy. In 2016, I won a Netty Award for Best Copywriting for my work on the ABC123.com website.

I’ve attached my résumé so you don’t have to dig through your files to find my application. Would you like to schedule a time to chat about the role?

All the best,

Eric Ferguson



**Referrals to Recruiters from Friends**

Hi Louis,



I had lunch with Eric Ferguson yesterday and he mentioned that ABC123 was planning to hire more writers soon. I graduated from NYU with a bachelor’s degree in English in September, and I’d love to learn more about your writing team and what makes them tick. And, of course, I’d love to talk to you about open roles. Do you have a few minutes for a video chat on Wednesday at around 1 p.m.?

All the best,

Julia Engels

## How to Write a Cold Email to a Recruiter

How to reach out to a recruiter to start a conversation: Your best option for making the first contact is a cold email or cold LinkedIn message. You want to keep your message brief and direct and show that you have a specific reason for messaging this particular recruiter. This will boost your chances of getting a response.

You don’t want to seem like you’re cold emailing 50 different recruiters, because if that’s the case, then none of them will want to put a lot of time or effort into helping you. [Most recruiters in staffing agencies get paid when you accept a job](https://careersidekick.com/should-i-use-recruiter-job-search/), and if 50 other recruiters are submitting your resume for jobs, their odds aren’t very good. So they’ll focus on helping someone else.

So to start, say something like, *“Hello NAME. I saw you recruit in the XYZ industry here in Chicago.”*

That way, they know it’s not just a cut & paste email.

**Next, tell them a bit about yourself and what your background is in, and what type of move you’re looking to make now.**

For example, you might go on to say, *“I’m a Sales Team Leader over at ABC Company, but I may be looking for a change in the next couple of months, so I thought to reach out to see if it made sense to work together.”*

**Next, here’s how to end your email to the recruiter:**

Conclude by asking them for a time to talk, and telling them you can provide them with more info on the call. This will boost your chances of getting their attention and getting them on the phone!

Whereas if you just send your resume or CV out to a recruiter without them asking for it, it’s very likely to get ignored or placed into a big pile that they never have time to look at.

So here’s a full sample email now, including the pieces above AND how to end your email to a recruiter:

> Hello NAME,
>
> I saw you recruit in the XYZ industry here in Chicago. I’m a Sales Team Leader over at ABC Company, but I may be looking for a change in the next couple of months, so I thought to reach out to see if it made sense to work together.
>
> Do you have a few minutes to talk this week? I’m happy to send a copy of my resume after that if it seems like a good fit to work together.
>
> Best regards,
>
> Your Name

## How to Email Your Resume or CV to a Recruiter

When you email your resume to a recruiter, it’s best if you’ve had a prior conversation (even if it’s just one back-and-forth email) to discuss why you thought to contact them, what you’re looking for in your job search, etc.

If you cold email your resume to a recruiter, they’re less likely to put time and effort into reading it closely. Whereas, if you email them with a brief note beforehand, as described in the previous section, they’ll be waiting eagerly for your resume and they’ll read it more closely!

### Word vs. PDF Resume Format for Your Resume

You may be wondering: Do recruiters prefer job seekers send a resume in Word or PDF format? They almost always prefer Word format, and you may have been asked specifically for this format in the past, especially when talking to recruiters from a staffing firm or recruitment agency.

**The reason recruiters prefer Word format is:** It’s easier to edit/change. If there’s a change they recommend, they can quickly call you or email you, get your permission to change it, and adjust it themselves.

And, recruiters often put a “stamp” at the top of your resume before submitting it to the various “clients” (aka employers they recruit for). That way, the hiring manager knows who referred you, so they know who to pay the commission to if you’re hired!

(Most agency recruiters work on “contingency” basis and are paid a fee – usually around 15-20% of your starting yearly salary – when you’re hired. Don’t worry, this does NOT come out of your pay. Ever. This is simply an additional fee that the company pays the recruiter for finding you for them! In fact, this is the only way most companies pay recruiters from staffing agencies).

## How to Respond to a Recruiter Email if They Contact You First

If a recruiter contacts you, then it’s best to carefully read their email first, and respond with the information they’ve asked for. If they tell you that they have an opportunity that may fit your skillset and they’d like to look at your resume, then you can respond with your resume right away. However, if you’re not comfortable doing this yet, you can ask for more information about the opportunity.

If they ask whether you’re interested in speaking and you do want to talk, then reply and say, “yes,” but also provide some times that you’re available to talk, and the best number to reach you.

This avoids back-and-forth and will impress the recruiter. Every employer loves someone with great communication skills, so this is a good way to show it from the very first message!

### Sample email template 1 (If they ask for your resume and you’re interested in working with them):

> Hi Bobby,
>
> Thanks for contacting me! The opportunity sounds great.
>
> I’ve attached a copy of my resume. Let me know the best time to talk and we’ll connect to discuss further. The best number to reach me is: 555-555-5555
>
> Best regards,
>
> Your Name

### Sample email template 2 (If they ask for your resume but you want to know more before sending it):

> Hi Jill,
>
> Thanks for getting in touch! The opportunity sounds interesting. Can we connect on the phone for a few minutes to discuss it in more detail? I usually don’t send my resume out without knowing a bit more about the opportunity first.
>
> I’m happy to send you my resume right after we talk if it seems like a good potential fit (or if you have other opportunities that may fit my background).
>
> The best number to reach me: 555-555-5555
>
> Best regards,
>
> Your Name

### Sample email template 3 (If they want to talk on the phone):

> Hi Sandra,
>
> Thanks for getting in touch! The position you mentioned sounds interesting. I’d love to talk and hear more about it.
>
> I could talk this week from Wed – Fri, 10 AM – 4 PM Eastern Time.
>
> My phone number: 555-555-5555
>
> Please let me know when you plan on calling so I can make sure I’m ready and available to answer.
>
> Best regards,
>
> Your Name

## How to End Your Email to a Recruiter

The best way to end your email to a recruiter is to sign off with, “Best regards” or “Thank you,” and then your name. You can see this in the email examples above. One more note: Before ending your email, make sure you addressed everything the recruiter asked for. If they requested your resume, you should either attach it or explain why it’s not attached (for example, if you prefer to talk first before sending it).

If you’re writing a cold email to a recruiter and not responding to them, then you should make sure you’ve clearly and directly asked for what you want before ending your email. For example, you could say, *“Please let me know if it sounds like a good fit to work together, and we can set up a time to talk this week.”*

**That’s called a “Call to Action” – a direct request for them to reply with specific information.**

**When cold emailing, always end your email with a “Call to Action”.** This improves your odds of hearing back. This is a tactic that professional marketers have used for years, and you can use it in your job search, too!

## Responding Directly to a Job Application: Email Sample

If you’re emailing in direct response to a job posted online, then use the template below (and I recommend you DO attach your resume directly, unlike the advice above for other scenarios).

> Dear NAME,
>
> I’m writing in response to the Senior Support Technician job posting. With X years in customer support in the technology industry, I’m confident I’d be a great fit in this role and could help <Company Name> do <main thing they appear to want, based on the job description>.
>
> Here’s a link to my LinkedIn profile so you can learn more about me: linkedin.com/in/yourURL
>
> I’ve also attached my resume to this email. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts after you’ve had a chance to look.
>
> Best regards,
>
> Your Name

This sample email for a job application can be used whether it’s going to recruiters, hiring managers, or a general company email. Use this when you see a posting online and want to reply directly to the posting to submit your resume for the job.

### Always make sure you add some customization to the email

Never cut & paste a generic email that you’re sending to every company. That’s not going to impress the hiring manager or get you a job offer.

You’ll be much better off if you mention their specific job title, company name, or both. And talk about why you though to apply for the job and why it’s worth their time to talk to you! (e.g. how you’d help THEM).

You’ll also notice that the job applicant email above contains your LinkedIn profile.

If you don’t have any information on your LinkedIn profile yet, I’d highly suggest filling it out! Hiring managers often look you up even if you don’t provide it. [This article explains all of the top reasons to use LinkedIn.](https://careersidekick.com/5-reasons-you-should-use-linkedin/)

Choose a clear subject line, too, like “Senior Support Technician – Application”. This will boost the chances that your email gets opened.

## When Should You Email a Recruiter?

There are a variety of situations where it’s appropriate to email a recruiter, and we looked at many of them above with sample emails you can send. To recap, here’s a list of scenarios where you should email a recruiter:

- You saw them post about a job that interests you
- You saw that they recruit in your industry/city and you’d like to talk about possible opportunities
- They contacted you about an opportunity and it sounds interesting
- You’ve already spoken with them and you’re waiting for feedback about a job
- You sent them your resume and you’re waiting to hear if they have any opportunities that fit your skillset
- You spoke to the recruiter in the past, it didn’t work out at the time, but you’d like to reconnect to see what opportunities they’re working on

These are far from the only situations where you should send an email to a recruiter, though. **So if in doubt, send that email! There’s no harm in trying, and it’s far worse to sit at home worrying and second-guessing yourself.**

As for the best time of day to email a recruiter, it’s not worth stressing over. Morning or lunchtime might be best, in my experience, but many recruiters check their email throughout the evening, too. And if not, they’ll see your email first thing in the morning.

So the best time of day to email a recruiter is whenever you’re ready to send your message.

## Conclusion

Recruiters can help job seekers get more opportunities, interviews, and job offers. As a recruiter, I’ve even helped people find their dream job when they had no connections or interviews before working with me!

But you need to get a recruiter’s attention first and be direct and professional in your message. That’s the best way to get recruiters to spend their time helping you find a new job.

Use the advice and templates above and you’ll get more responses and more help when sending emails and cold messages to recruiters. 

As a final word of advice, make sure you have a professional-sounding email address, too.

And if you’re giving out your phone number in your emails or on your resume, go listen to your voicemail recording to check if it sounds professional. You may have recorded it many years ago and forgotten about it, so it’s worth checking.

-----------------------

Recruiters want to get to know you. Their jobs depend on finding and hiring successful candidates just like you everyday. Yet many job seekers are afraid of reaching out to recruiters. When they do, they fumble words, aren’t timely or don’t convey enough interest in the role to gain a reply, let alone a job offer. I hate seeing skilled applicants lose out on a better life because they didn’t know how to communicate with a recruiter.

The good news is there’s a proven way to reach out to recruiters and get a response – break away from the pack with these tips:

## **1. Know what you want.**

One of the worst ways to reach out to a recruiter is with a vague request that only benefits you. Think about how you can make the recruiter’s life easier instead of wasting their time.

“Have time to chat?” – Most likely not since they’re reviewing hundreds of applicants. Also, chat about what?

“I’m interested in this job – would you know something about it?” Yes, it’s their job to know.

Have a specific purpose for reaching out other than wanting a job – which is why everyone is applying in the first place. Learning about company culture, asking for introductions to the hiring team or getting feedback on your candidacy are great reasons to reach out to a recruiter.

## **2. Keep it short and sweet.**

Recruiters get anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds to review each applicant. They have even less time for answering emails from people that would like to borrow some of their time to chat.

By keeping things short, you are respectful of the recruiter’s busy schedule and are more likely to receive a response. Messages shouldn’t be more than 2 minute read. Anything longer will be “saved for later,” but more likely will be forgotten and never opened again. How many times have you done this with your own email?

## **3. Observe the power dynamic and be respectful.**

You’re the one requesting a job from someone with an extremely busy schedule. The recruiter’s opinion of you can make or break your job offer.

Be respectful with your tone and requests. Start small and always give the final choice to the recruiter.

“I applied to this position. Can you forward my application to the hiring manager?” Why does the recruiter owe you a favor? This is too direct for an introduction.

“I want talk about Acme Co. I’m free on Tuesday at 4PM and Thursday at 3PM.” This assumes the recruiter wants to talk to you, which may not be the case. Also, you want to give the choice of time to the person in power by offering a range of options. Being strict upfront isn’t a good first impression to set.

Being respectful shows you’re likely a pleasant person to work with, another plus in your job candidacy.

## **4. Make decision making easy.**

Your goal with the first email is to get a yes to the introduction and a small request, not a job offer. While it’s possible to get a job with a single email, it’s highly unlikely for most people. Since you’re likely to have multiple email exchanges with your recruiter, start off small with easy “yes or no” questions.

“I applied to Acme Inc. How do you like it there?” This question begs for a long response, which probably won’t happen.
