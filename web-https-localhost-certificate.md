Most of the time, `http://localhost` does what you need: in browsers, it mostly behaves like HTTPS üîí. That's why some APIs that won't work on a deployed HTTP site, will work on `http://localhost`.

What this means is that you need to use HTTPS locally **only in special cases** (see [When to use HTTPS for local development](https://web.dev/when-to-use-local-https)), like custom hostnames or Secure cookies across browsers. Keep reading if that's you!

*In this post, statements about `localhost` are valid for `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` as well, since they both describe the local computer address, also called "loopback address". Also, to keep things simple, the port number isn't specified.* *So when you see `http://localhost`, read it as `http://localhost:{PORT}` or `http://127.0.0.1:{PORT}`.*

If your production website uses HTTPS, you want your local development site to behave **like an HTTPS site** (if your production website doesn't use HTTPS, [make it a priority to switch to HTTPS](https://web.dev/why-https-matters/)). Most of the time, you can trust `http://localhost` to behave **like an HTTPS site**. But [in some cases](https://web.dev/when-to-use-local-https), you need to run your site locally with HTTPS. Let's take a look at how to do this.

## Running your site locally with HTTPS using mkcert (recommended) [#](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/#running-your-site-locally-with-https-using-mkcert-(recommended))

To use HTTPS with your local development site and access `https://localhost` or `https://mysite.example` (custom hostname), you need a [TLS certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate#TLS/SSL_server_certificate). But browsers won't consider just any certificate valid: your certificate needs to be **signed** by an entity that is trusted by your browser, called a trusted **[certificate authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)**.

What you need to do is to create a certificate and sign it with a CA that is **trusted locally** by your device and browser. [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is a tool that helps you do this in a few commands. Here's how it works:

- If you open your locally running site in your browser using HTTPS, your browser will check the certificate of your local development server.
- Upon seeing that the certificate has been signed by the mkcert-generated certificate authority, the browser checks whether it's registered as a trusted certificate authority.
- mkcert is listed as a trusted authority, so your browser trusts the certificate and creates an HTTPS connection.

mkcert (and similar tools) provide several benefits:

- mkcert is specialized in creating certificates that are **compliant with what browsers consider valid certificates**. It stays updated to match requirements and best practices. This is why you won't have to run mkcert commands with complex configurations or arguments to generate the right certificates!
- mkcert is a cross-platform tool. Anyone on your team can use it.

mkcert is the tool we recommend for creating a TLS certificate for local development. You can check out [other options](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/#running-your-site-locally-with-https:-other-options) too.

Many operating systems may include libraries to produce certificates, such as [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/). Unlike mkcert and similar tools, such libraries may not consistently produce correct certificates, may require complex commands to be run, and are not necessarily cross-platform.
