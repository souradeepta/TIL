# Using Buffers in Node.js

### Introduction

A *buffer* is a space in memory (typically RAM) that stores binary data. In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), we can access these spaces of memory with the built-in `Buffer` class. Buffers store a sequence of integers, similar to an [array](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-arrays-in-javascript) in [JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript). Unlike arrays, you cannot change the size of a buffer once it is created.

You may have used buffers implicitly if you wrote Node.js code already. For example, when you read from a file with [`fs.readFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system), the data returned to the [callback or Promise](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-asynchronous-code-in-node-js) is a buffer [object](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-objects-in-javascript). Additionally, when HTTP requests are made in Node.js, they return data streams that are temporarily stored in an internal buffer when the client cannot process the stream all at once.

Buffers are useful when you’re interacting with binary data, usually at lower networking levels. They also equip you with the ability to do fine-grained data manipulation in Node.js.

In this tutorial, you will use the [Node.js REPL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-node-js-repl) to run through various examples of buffers, such as creating buffers, reading from buffers, writing to and copying from buffers, and using buffers to convert between binary and encoded data. By the end of the tutorial, you’ll have learned how to use the `Buffer` class to work with binary data.

## Step 1 — Creating a Buffer

This first step will show you the two primary ways to create a buffer object in Node.js.

To decide what method to use, you need to answer this question: Do you want to create a new buffer or extract a buffer from existing data? If you are going to store data in memory that you have yet to receive, you’ll want to create a new buffer. In Node.js we use the `alloc()` function of the `Buffer` [class](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-classes-in-javascript) to do this.

Let’s open the [Node.js REPL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-node-js-repl) to see for ourselves. In your terminal, enter the `node` command:

```bash
node
```

 

Copy

You will see the prompt begin with `>`.

The `alloc()` function takes the size of the buffer as its first and only required argument. The size is an integer representing how many bytes of memory the buffer object will use. For example, if we wanted to create a buffer that was 1KB (kilobyte) large, equivalent to 1024 bytes, we would enter this in the console:

```bash
const firstBuf = Buffer.alloc(1024);
```

 

Copy

To create a new buffer, we used the globally available `Buffer` class, which has the `alloc()` method. By providing `1024` as the argument for `alloc()`, we created a buffer that’s 1KB large.

By default, when you initialize a buffer with `alloc()`, the buffer is filled with binary zeroes as a placeholder for later data. However, we can change the default value if we’d like to. If we wanted to create a new buffer with `1`s instead of `0`s, we would set the `alloc()` function’s second parameter—`fill`.

In your terminal, create a new buffer at the REPL prompt that’s filled with `1`s:

```bash
const filledBuf = Buffer.alloc(1024, 1);
```

 

Copy

We just created a new buffer object that references a space in memory that stores 1KB of `1`s. Although we entered an integer, all data stored in a buffer is binary data.

Binary data can come in many different formats. For example, let’s consider a binary sequence representing a byte of data: `01110110`. If this binary sequence represented a [string](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-strings-in-javascript) in English using [the ASCII encoding standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), it would be the letter `v`. However, if our computer was processing an image, that binary sequence could contain information about the color of a pixel.

The computer knows to process them differently because the bytes are encoded differently. Byte encoding is the format of the byte. A buffer in Node.js uses the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding scheme by default if it’s initialized with string data. A byte in UTF-8 represents a number, a letter (in English and in other languages), or a symbol. UTF-8 is a superset of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII can encode bytes with uppercase and lowercase English letters, the numbers 0-9, and a few other symbols like the exclamation mark (**!**) or the ampersand sign (**&**).

If we were writing a program that could only work with ASCII characters, we could change the encoding used by our buffer with the `alloc()` function’s third argument—`encoding`.

Let’s create a new buffer that’s five bytes long and stores only ASCII characters:

```bash
const asciiBuf = Buffer.alloc(5, 'a', 'ascii');
```

 

Copy

The buffer is initialized with five bytes of the character `a`, using the ASCII representation.

**Note**: By default, Node.js supports the following character encodings:**ASCII**, represented as `ascii`**UTF-8**, represented as `utf-8` or `utf8`[**UTF-16**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16), represented as `utf-16le` or `utf16le`[**UCS-2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set), represented as `ucs-2` or `ucs2`[**Base64**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64), represented as `base64`[**Hexadecimal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal), represented as `hex`[**ISO/IEC 8859-1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1), represented as `latin1` or `binary`All of these values can be used in Buffer class functions that accept an `encoding` parameter. Therefore, these values are all valid for the `alloc()` method.

So far we’ve been creating new buffers with the `alloc()` function. But sometimes we may want to create a buffer from data that already exists, like a string or array.

To create a buffer from pre-existing data, we use the `from()` method. We can use that function to create buffers from:

- An array of integers: The integer values can be between `0` and `255`.
- An `ArrayBuffer`: This is a JavaScript object that stores a fixed length of bytes.
- A string.
- Another buffer.
- Other JavaScript objects that have a `Symbol.toPrimitive` property. That property tells JavaScript how to convert the object to a primitive data type: `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `number`, `string`, or `symbol`. You can read more about Symbols at Mozilla’s JavaScript [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).

Let’s see how we can create a buffer from a string. In the Node.js prompt, enter this:

```bash
const stringBuf = Buffer.from('My name is Paul');
```

 

Copy

We now have a buffer object created from the string `My name is Paul`. Let’s create a new buffer from another buffer we made earlier:

```bash
const asciiCopy = Buffer.from(asciiBuf);
```

 

Copy

We’ve now created a new buffer `asciiCopy` that contains the same data as `asciiBuf`.

Now that we have experienced creating buffers, we can dive into examples of reading their data.



## Step 2 — Reading from a Buffer

There are many ways to access data in a Buffer. We can access an individual byte in a buffer or we can extract the entire contents.

To access one byte of a buffer, we pass the index or location of the byte we want. Buffers store data sequentially like arrays. They also index their data like arrays, starting at `0`. We can use array notation on the buffer object to get an individual byte.

Let’s see how this looks by creating a buffer from a string in the REPL:

```bash
const hiBuf = Buffer.from('Hi!');
```

 

Copy

Now let’s read the first byte of the buffer:

```bash
hiBuf[0];
```

 

Copy

As you press `ENTER`, the REPL will display:

```
Output72
```

The integer `72` corresponds the UTF-8 representation for the letter `H`.

**Note**: The values for bytes can be numbers between `0` and `255`. A byte is a sequence of 8 bits. A bit is binary, and therefore can only have one of two values: `0` or `1`. If we have a sequence of 8 bits and two possible values per bit, then we have a maximum of 2⁸ possible values for a byte. That works out to a maximum of 256 values. Since we start counting from zero, that means our highest number is 255.

Let’s do the same for the second byte. Enter the following in the REPL:

```bash
hiBuf[1];
```

 

Copy

The REPL returns `105`, which represents the lowercase `i`.

Finally, let’s get the third character:

```bash
hiBuf[2];
```

 

Copy

You will see `33` displayed in the REPL, which corresponds to `!`.

Let’s try to retrieve a byte from an invalid index:

```bash
hiBuf[3];
```

 

Copy

The REPL will return:

```
Outputundefined
```

This is just like if we tried to access an element in an array with an incorrect index.

Now that we’ve seen how to read individual bytes of a buffer, let’s see our options for retrieving all the data stored in a buffer at once. The buffer object comes with the `toString()` and the `toJSON()` methods, which return the entire contents of a buffer in two different formats.

As its name suggests, the `toString()` method converts the bytes of the buffer into a string and returns it to the user. If we use this method on `hiBuf`, we will get the string `Hi!`. Let’s try it!

In the prompt, enter:

```bash
hiBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

The REPL will return:

```
Output'Hi!'
```

That buffer was created from a string. Let’s see what happens if we use the `toString()` on a buffer that was not made from string data.

Let’s create a new, empty buffer that’s `10` bytes large:

```bash
const tenZeroes = Buffer.alloc(10);
```

 

Copy

Now, let’s use the `toString()` method:

```bash
tenZeroes.toString();
```

 

Copy

We will see the following result:

```
'\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000'
```

The string `\u0000` is the Unicode character for `NULL`. It corresponds to the number `0`. When the buffer’s data is not encoded as a string, the `toString()` method returns the UTF-8 encoding of the bytes.

The `toString()` has an optional parameter, `encoding`. We can use this parameter to change the encoding of the buffer data that’s returned.

For example, if you wanted the hexadecimal encoding for `hiBuf` you would enter the following at the prompt:

```bash
hiBuf.toString('hex');
```

 

Copy

That statement will evaluate to:

```
Output'486921'
```

`486921` is the hexadecimal representation for the bytes that represent the string `Hi!`. In Node.js, when users want to convert the encoding of data from one form to another, they usually put the string in a buffer and call `toString()` with their desired encoding.

The `toJSON()` method behaves differently. Regardless of whether the buffer was made from a string or not, it always returns the data as the integer representation of the byte.

Let’s re-use the `hiBuf` and `tenZeroes` buffers to practice using `toJSON()`. At the prompt, enter:

```bash
hiBuf.toJSON();
```

 

Copy

The REPL will return:

```
Output{ type: 'Buffer', data: [ 72, 105, 33 ] }
```

The JSON object has a `type` property that will always be `Buffer`. That’s so programs can distinguish these JSON object from other JSON objects.

The `data` property contains an array of the integer representation of the bytes. You may have noticed that `72`, `105`, and `33` correspond to the values we received when we individually pulled the bytes.

Let’s try the `toJSON()` method with `tenZeroes`:

```bash
tenZeroes.toJSON();
```

 

Copy

In the REPL you will see the following:

```
Output{ type: 'Buffer', data: [
    0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 0, 0
  ] }
```

The `type` is the same as noted before. However, the data is now an array with ten zeroes.

Now that we’ve covered the main ways to read from a buffer, let’s look at how we modify a buffer’s contents.



## Step 3 — Modifying a Buffer

There are many ways we can modify an existing buffer object. Similar to reading, we can modify buffer bytes individually using the array syntax. We can also write new contents to a buffer, replacing the existing data.

Let’s begin by looking at how we can change individual bytes of a buffer. Recall our buffer variable `hiBuf`, which contains the string `Hi!`. Let’s change each byte so that it contains `Hey` instead.

In the REPL, let’s first try setting the second element of `hiBuf` to `e`:

```bash
hiBuf[1] = 'e';
```

 

Copy

Now, let’s see this buffer as a string to confirm it’s storing the right data. Follow up by calling the `toString()` method:

```bash
hiBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

It will be evaluated as:

```
Output'H\u0000!'
```

We received that strange output because the buffer can only accept an integer value. We can’t assign it to the letter `e`; rather, we have to assign it the number whose binary equivalent represents `e`:

```bash
hiBuf[1] = 101;
```

 

Copy

Now when we call the `toString()` method:

```bash
hiBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

We get this output in the REPL:

```
Output'He!'
```

To change the last character in the buffer, we need to set the third element to the integer that corresponds to the byte for `y`:

```bash
hiBuf[2] = 121;
```

 

Copy

Let’s confirm by using the `toString()` method once again:

```bash
hiBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

Your REPL will display:

```
Output'Hey'
```

If we try to write a byte that’s outside the range of the buffer, it will be ignored and the contents of the buffer won’t change. For example, let’s try to set the non-existent fourth element of the buffer to `o`:

```bash
hiBuf[3] = 111;
```

 

Copy

We can confirm that the buffer is unchanged with the `toString()` method:

```bash
hiBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

The output is still:

```
Output'Hey'
```

If we wanted to change the contents of the entire buffer, we can use the `write()` method. The `write()` method accepts a string that will replace the contents of a buffer.

Let’s use the `write()` method to change the contents of `hiBuf` back to `Hi!`. In your Node.js shell, type the following command at the prompt:

```bash
hiBuf.write('Hi!');
```

 

Copy

The `write()` method returned `3` in the REPL. This is because it wrote three bytes of data. Each letter has one byte in size, since this buffer uses UTF-8 encoding, which uses a byte for each character. If the buffer used UTF-16 encoding, which has a minimum of two bytes per character, then the `write()` function would have returned `6`.

Now verify the contents of the buffer by using `toString()`:

```bash
hiBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

The REPL will produce:

```
Output'Hi!'
```

This is quicker than having to change each element byte-by-byte.

If you try to write more bytes than a buffer’s size, the buffer object will only accept what bytes fit. To illustrate, let’s create a buffer that stores three bytes:

```bash
const petBuf = Buffer.alloc(3);
```

 

Copy

Now let’s attempt to write `Cats` to it:

```bash
petBuf.write('Cats');
```

 

Copy

When the `write()` call is evaluated, the REPL returns `3` indicating only three bytes were written to the buffer. Now confirm that the buffer contains the first three bytes:

```bash
petBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

The REPL returns:

```
Output'Cat'
```

The `write()` function adds the bytes in sequential order, so only the first three bytes were placed in the buffer.

By contrast, let’s make a `Buffer` that stores four bytes:

```bash
const petBuf2 = Buffer.alloc(4);
```

 

Copy

Write the same contents to it:

```bash
petBuf2.write('Cats');
```

 

Copy

Then add some new content that occupies less space than the original content:

```bash
petBuf2.write('Hi');
```

 

Copy

Since buffers write sequentially, starting from `0`, if we print the buffer’s contents:

```bash
petBuf2.toString();
```

 

Copy

We’d be greeted with:

```
Output'Hits'
```

The first two characters are overwritten, but the rest of the buffer is untouched.

Sometimes the data we want in our pre-existing buffer is not in a string but resides in another buffer object. In these cases, we can use the `copy()` function to modify what our buffer is storing.

Let’s create two new buffers:

```bash
const wordsBuf = Buffer.from('Banana Nananana');
const catchphraseBuf = Buffer.from('Not sure Turtle!');
```

 

Copy

The `wordsBuf` and `catchphraseBuf` buffers both contain string data. We want to modify `catchphraseBuf` so that it stores `Nananana Turtle!` instead of `Not sure Turtle!`. We’ll use `copy()` to get `Nananana` from `wordsBuf` to `catchphraseBuf`.

To copy data from one buffer to the other, we’ll use the `copy()` method on the buffer that’s the source of the information. Therefore, as `wordsBuf` has the string data we want to copy, we need to copy like this:

```bash
wordsBuf.copy(catchphraseBuf);
```

 

Copy

The `target` parameter in this case is the `catchphraseBuf` buffer.

When we enter that into the REPL, it returns `15` indicating that 15 bytes were written. The string `Nananana` only uses 8 bytes of data, so we immediately know that our copy did not go as intended. Use the `toString()` method to see the contents of `catchphraseBuf`:

```bash
catchphraseBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

The REPL returns:

```
Output'Banana Nananana!'
```

By default, `copy()` took the entire contents of `wordsBuf` and placed it into `catchphraseBuf`. We need to be more selective for our goal and only copy `Nananana`. Let’s re-write the original contents of `catchphraseBuf` before continuing:

```bash
catchphraseBuf.write('Not sure Turtle!');
```

 

Copy

The `copy()` function has a few more parameters that allow us to customize what data is copied to the other buffer. Here’s a list of all the parameters of this function:

- `target` - This is the only required parameter of `copy()`. As we’ve seen from our previous usage, it is the buffer we want to copy to.
- `targetStart` - This is the index of the bytes in the target buffer where we should begin copying to. By default it’s `0`, meaning it copies data starting at the beginning of the buffer.
- `sourceStart` - This is the index of the bytes in the source buffer where we should copy from.
- `sourceEnd` - This is the index of the bytes in the source buffer where we should stop copying. By default, it’s the length of the buffer.

So, to copy `Nananana` from `wordsBuf` into `catchphraseBuf`, our `target` should be `catchphraseBuf` like before. The `targetStart` would be `0` as we want `Nananana` to appear at the beginning of `catchphraseBuf`. The `sourceStart` should be `7` as that’s the index where `Nananana` begins in `wordsBuf`. The `sourceEnd` would continue to be the length of the buffers.

At the REPL prompt, copy the contents of `wordsBuf` like this:

```bash
wordsBuf.copy(catchphraseBuf, 0, 7, wordsBuf.length);
```

 

Copy

The REPL confirms that `8` bytes have been written. Note how `wordsBuf.length` is used as the value for the `sourceEnd` parameter. Like arrays, the `length` property gives us the size of the buffer.

Now let’s see the contents of `catchphraseBuf`:

```bash
catchphraseBuf.toString();
```

 

Copy

The REPL returns:

```
Output'Nananana Turtle!'
```

Success! We were able to modify the data of `catchphraseBuf` by copying the contents of `wordsBuf`.

You can exit the Node.js REPL if you would like to do so. Note that all the variables that were created will no longer be available when you do:

```bash
.exit
```

 

Copy



## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned that buffers are fixed-length allocations in memory that store binary data. You first created buffers by defining their size in memory and by initializing them with pre-existing data. You then read data from a buffer by examining their individual bytes and by using the `toString()` and `toJSON()` methods. Finally, you modified the data stored by a buffer by changing its individual bytes and by using the `write()` and `copy()` methods.

Buffers give you great insight into how binary data is manipulated by Node.js. Now that you can interact with buffers, you can observe the different ways character encoding affect how data is stored. For example, you can create buffers from string data that are not UTF-8 or ASCII encoding and observe their difference in size. You can also take a buffer with UTF-8 and use `toString()` to convert it to other encoding schemes.
