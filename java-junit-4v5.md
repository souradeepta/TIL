# JUnit 5 vs JUnit 4

JUnit 5 aims to adapt java 8 style of coding and to be more robust and flexible than JUnit 4. In this post, **JUnit 5 vs JUnit 4**, we will focus on some major differences between junit 4 and junit 5.

## 1. JUnit 5 vs JUnit 4 â€“ Annotations

Most of annotations in both versions are same, but few differs. Here is a quick comparison.

| FEATURE                                              | JUNIT 4        | JUNIT 5        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Declare a test method                                | `@Test`        | `@Test`        |
| Execute before all test methods in the current class | `@BeforeClass` | `@BeforeAll`   |
| Execute after all test methods in the current class  | `@AfterClass`  | `@AfterAll`    |
| Execute before each test method                      | `@Before`      | `@BeforeEach`  |
| Execute after each test method                       | `@After`       | `@AfterEach`   |
| Disable a test method / class                        | `@Ignore`      | `@Disabled`    |
| Test factory for dynamic tests                       | NA             | `@TestFactory` |
| Nested tests                                         | NA             | `@Nested`      |
| Tagging and filtering                                | `@Category`    | `@Tag`         |
| Register custom extensions                           | NA             | `@ExtendWith`  |

## 2. Other differences between JUnit 5 and JUnit 4

#### 2.1. Architecture

JUnit 4 has everything bundled into single jar file.

Junit 5 is composed of 3 sub-projects i.e. JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter and JUnit Vintage.

1. ##### JUnit Platform

   It defines the `TestEngine` API for developing new testing frameworks that runs on the platform.

2. ##### JUnit Jupiter

   It has all new junit annotations and `TestEngine` implementation to run tests written with these annotations.

3. ##### JUnit Vintage

   To support running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 written tests on the JUnit 5 platform.

#### 2.2. Required JDK Version

Junit 4 requires Java 5 or higher.

Junit 5 requires Java 8 or higher.

#### 2.3. Assertions

In Junit 4, [org.junit.Assert](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/Assert.html) has all assert methods to validate expected and resulted outcomes.
They accept extra parameter for error message as FIRST argument in method signature. e.g.

```java
public static void assertEquals(long expected, long actual)
public static void assertEquals(String message, long expected, long actual)
```

In JUnit 5, [org.junit.jupiter.Assertions](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html) contains most of assert methods including additional `assertThrows()` and `assertAll()` methods. `assertAll()` is in experimental state as of today, and is used for grouped assertions.
JUnit 5 assertions methods also have overloaded methods to support passing error message to be printed in case test fails e.g.

```java
public static void assertEquals(long expected, long actual)
public static void assertEquals(long expected, long actual, String message)
public static void assertEquals(long expected, long actual, Supplier messageSupplier)
```

#### 2.4. Assumptions

In Junit 4, [org.junit.Assume](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/Assume.html) contains methods for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. It has following five methods:

1. assumeFalse()
2. assumeNoException()
3. assumeNotNull()
4. assumeThat()
5. assumeTrue()

In Junit 5, [org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assumptions.html) contains methods for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. It has following three methods:

1. assumeFalse()
2. assumingThat()
3. assumeTrue()

#### 2.5. Tagging and Filtering

In Junit 4, `@category` annotation is used.

In Junit 5, `@tag` annotation is used.

#### 2.6. Test Suites

In Junit 4, `@RunWith` and `@Suite` annotation. e.g.

```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Suite;
 
@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({
        ExceptionTest.class, 
        TimeoutTest.class
})
public class JUnit4Example 
{
}
```

In Junit 5, `@RunWith`, `@SelectPackages` and `@SelectClasses` e.g.

```java
import org.junit.platform.runner.JUnitPlatform;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectPackages;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
 
@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)
@SelectPackages("com.howtodoinjava.junit5.examples")
public class JUnit5Example 
{
}
```

#### 2.7. 3rd Party Integration

In Junit 4, there is no integration support for 3rd party plugins and IDEs. They have to rely on [reflection](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/related-concepts/real-usage-examples-of-reflection-in-java/).

JUnit 5 has dedicated sub-project for this purpose i.e. JUnit Platform. It defines the `TestEngine` API for developing a testing framework that runs on the platform.
