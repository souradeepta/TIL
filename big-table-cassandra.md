# BigTable Model with Cassandra and HBase

Recently in a number of "scalability discussion meeting", I've seen the following pattern coming up repeatedly ...

1. To make your app scalable, you try to make your app layer “stateless”.
2. OK, so you move the "state" out from your application layer out to a shared DB, or shared data layer.
3. Now, how do we make the data tier scalable, by definition, we cannot make the data tier stateless.
4. OK, now lets think about how to "partition" your data and spread them  across multiple machines in such a way that workload is balanced.
5. Now there are more boxes and what if some of them crashes.
6. OK, we should replicate the data across machines.
7. Now, how do we keep these data in sync ...
8. And then Cloud computing gets into the picture (as it always does).  Now we are not just having a pool of machines but also the pool size can grow  and shrink according to workload fluctuation (you don't want to pay for  something idle, right ?).
9. Now we need to figure out as we add  more machines into the pool or remove machine from the pool, how we  should "redistribute" the data.

This is an area where NOSQL shines.  In the last 18 months, NOSQL has become one of the hottest  topic in the software industry.  It has been introduced as a solution to large scale data storage problem at the range of Terabytes or  Petabytes.  Dozens of NOSQL products has come to the market, but two  leaders HBase and Cassandra seems to stand out from the rest in terms of their adoption.

Given an increasing demand of explaining these 2 products recently, I decide to write a post on this.

*Not to repeat the basic theory of NOSQL here, for a foundation of* [distributed system theory underlying the NOSQL design](http://horicky.blogspot.com/2009/11/nosql-patterns.html)*, please refer to* [my earlier blog](http://horicky.blogspot.com/2009/11/nosql-patterns.html)

Both Hbase and Cassandra are based on Google BigTable model, here lets  introduce some key characteristic underlying Bigtable first.

**Fundamentally Distributed**
BigTable is built from the ground up on a "highly distributed", "share nothing"  architecture.  Data is supposed to store in large number of unreliable,  commodity server boxes by "partitioning" and "replication".  Data  partitioning means the data are partitioned by its key and stored in  different servers.  Replication means the same data element is  replicated multiple times at different servers.

## **Column Oriented**

Unlike traditional RDBMS implementation where each "row" is stored contiguous  on disk, BigTable, on the other hand, store each column contiguously on  disk.  The underlying assumption is that in most cases not all columns  are needed for data access, column oriented layout allows more records  sitting in a disk block and hence can reduce the disk I/O.

Column oriented layout is also very effective to store very sparse data (many  cells have NULL value) as well as multi-value cell.  The following  diagram illustrate the difference between a Row-oriented layout and a  Column-oriented layout

## **Variable number of Columns**

In RDBMS, each row must have a fixed set of columns defined by the table  schema, and therefore it is not easy to support columns with multi-value attributes.  The BigTable model introduces the "Column Family" concept  such that a row has a fixed number of "column family" but within the  "column family", a row can have a variable number of columns that can be different in each row.

[![img](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_j6mB7TMmJJY/TK3rvDfWSFI/AAAAAAAAAeY/kD1z9eBG_iw/s400/P5.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_j6mB7TMmJJY/TK3rvDfWSFI/AAAAAAAAAeY/kD1z9eBG_iw/s1600/P5.png)
In the Bigtable model, the basic data storage unit is a cell, (addressed  by a particular row and column).  Bigtable allow multiple timestamp  version of data within a cell.  In other words, user can address a data  element by the rowid, column name and the timestamp.  At the  configuration level, Bigtable allows the user to specify how many  versions can be stored within each cell either by count (how many) or by freshness (how old).

At the physical level, BigTable store each  column family contiguously on disk (imagine one file per column family), and physically sort the order of data by rowid, column name and  timestamp.  After that, the sorted data will be compressed so that a  disk block size can store more data.  On the other hand, since data  within a column family usually has a similar pattern, data compression  can be very effective.

**Note:**  Although not shown in this example, rowid of different column families  can be completely different types.  For example, in the above example, I can have another column family "UserIdx" whose rowid is a string  (user's name) and it has columns whose columnKey is the u1, u2 (ie: the  row id of the User Column family) and columnValue is null (ie: not  used).   This is a common technique to build index at the application  level.

## **Sequential write**

BigTable model is highly optimized for write operation (insert/update/delete)  with sequential write (no disk seek is needed).  Basically, write  happens by first appending a transaction entry to a log file (hence the  disk write I/O is sequential with no disk seek), followed by writing the data into an in-memory Memtable  .  In case of the machine crashes and  all in-memory state is lost, the recovery step will bring the Memtable  up to date by replaying the updates in the log file.

All the  latest update therefore will be stored at the Memtable, which will grow  until reaching a size threshold, then it will flushed the Memtable to  the disk as an SSTable (sorted by the String key).  Over a period of  time there will be multiple SSTables on the disk that store the data.

##  **Merged read**

Whenever a read request is received, the system will first lookup the Memtable  by its row key to see if it contains the data.  If not, it will look at  the on-disk SSTable to see if the row-key is there.  We call this the  "merged read" as the system need to look at multiple places for the  data.  To speed up the detection, SSTable has a companion Bloom filter  such that it can rapidly detect the absence of the row-key.  In other  words, only when the bloom filter returns positive will the system be  doing a detail lookup within the SSTable.

## **Periodic Data Compaction**

As you can imagine, it can be quite inefficient for the read operation  when there are too many SSTables scattering around.  Therefore, the  system periodically merge the SSTable.  Notice that since each of the  SSTable is individually sorted by key, a simple "merge sort" is  sufficient to merge multiple SSTable into one.  The merge mechanism is  based on a logarithm property where two SSTable of the same size will be merge into a single SSTable will doubling the size.  Therefore the  number of SSTable is proportion to O(logN) where N is the number of  rows.

After looking at the common part, lets look at their difference of Hbase and Cassandra.

## **HBase**

Based on the BigTable, HBase uses the Hadoop Filesystem (HDFS) as its data  storage engine.  The advantage of this approach is then HBase doesn't  need to worry about data replication, data consistency and resiliency  because HDFS has handled it already.  Of course, the downside is that it is also constrained by the characteristics of HDFS, which is not  optimized for random read access.  In addition, there will be an extra  network latency between the DB server to the File server (which is the  data node of Hadoop).

In the HBase architecture, data is stored in a farm of Region Servers.   The "key-to-server" mapping is needed to locate the corresponding server and this mapping is stored as a "Table" similar to other user data  table.

Before a client do any DB operation, it needs to first locate the corresponding region server.

1. The client contacts a predefined Master server who replies the endpoint of a region server that holds a "Root Region" table.
2. The client contacts the region server who replies the endpoint of a second  region server who holds a "Meta Region" table, which contains a mapping  from "user table" to "region server".
3. The client contacts this  second region server, passing along the user table name.  This second  region server will lookup its meta region and reply an endpoint of a  third region server who holds a "User Region", which contains a mapping  from "key range" to "region server"
4. The client contacts this  third region server, passing along the row key that it wants to lookup.  This third region server will lookup its user region and reply the  endpoint of a fourth region server who holds the data that the client is looking for.
5. Client will cache the result along this process so subsequent request doesn't need to go through this multi-step process  again to resolve the corresponding endpoint.

In Hbase, the in-memory data storage (what we refer to as "Memtable" in above paragraph) is implemented in [Memcache](http://horicky.blogspot.com/2009/10/notes-on-memcached.html).  The on-disk data storage (what we refer to as "SSTable" in above  paragraph) is implemented as a HDFS file residing in Hadoop data node  server.  The Log file is also stored as an HDFS file.  (I feel storing a transaction log file remotely will hurt performance)

Also in the HBase architecture, there is a special machine playing the "role of  master" who monitors and coordinates the activities of all region  servers (the heavy-duty worker node).  To the best of my knowledge, the  master node is the single point of failure at this moment.

For a more detail architecture description, Lars George has a very good explanation in the [log file implementation](http://www.larsgeorge.com/2010/01/hbase-architecture-101-write-ahead-log.html) as well as the [data storage architecture](http://www.larsgeorge.com/2009/10/hbase-architecture-101-storage.html) of Hbase.

## **Cassandra**

Also based on the BigTable model, Cassandra use the DHT (distributed hash  table) model to partition its data, based on the paper described in the [Amazon Dynamo model](http://s3.amazonaws.com/AllThingsDistributed/sosp/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf).

### **Consistent Hashing via O(1) DHT**

Each machine (node) is associated with a particular id that is distributed  in a keyspace (e.g. 128 bit).  All the data element is also associated  with a key (in the same key space).  The server owns all the data whose  key lies between its id and the preceding server's id.

Data is  also replicated across multiple servers.  Cassandra offers multiple  replication schema including storing the replicas in neighbor servers  (whose id succeed the server owning the data), or a rack-aware strategy  by storing the replicas in a physical location.  The simple partition  strategy is as follows ...

[![img](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j6mB7TMmJJY/TK4tcDyi7sI/AAAAAAAAAe4/aCd9EC9fX74/s400/P7.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j6mB7TMmJJY/TK4tcDyi7sI/AAAAAAAAAe4/aCd9EC9fX74/s1600/P7.png)

### **Tunable Consistency Level**

Unlike Hbase, Cassandra allows you to choose the consistency level that is  suitable to your application, so you can gain more scalability if  willing to tradeoff some data consistency.

For example, it allows you to choose how many ACK to receive from different replicas before  considering a WRITE to be successful.  Similarly, you can choose how  many replica's response to be received in the case of READ before return the result to the client.

By choosing the appropriate number for W and R response, you can choose the level of consistency you like.   For example, to achieve Strict Consistency, we just need to pick W, R  such that W + R > N.  This including the possibility of (W = one and R = all), (R = one and W = all), (W = quorum and R = quorum).  Of course, if you don't need strict consistency, you can even choose a smaller  value for W and R and gain a bigger availability.  Regardless of what  consistency level you choose, the data will be eventual consistent by  the "hinted handoff", "read repair" and "anti-entropy sync" mechanism  described below.

### **Hinted Handoff**

The client performs a write by send the request to any Cassandra node which will act as the proxy to the client.  This proxy node will located N  corresponding nodes that holds the data replicas and forward the write  request to all of them.  In case any node is failed, it will pick a  random node as a handoff node and write the request with a hint telling  it to forward the write request back to the failed node after it  recovers.    The handoff node will then periodically check for the  recovery of the failed node and forward the write to it.  Therefore, the original node will eventually receive all the write request.

### **Conflict Resolution**

Since write can reach different replica, the corresponding timestamp of the  data is used to resolve conflict, in other words, the latest timestamp  wins and push the earlier timestamps into an earlier version (they are  not lost)

### **Read Repair**

When the client performs a "read", the proxy node will issue N reads but  only wait for R copies of responses and return the one with the latest  version.  In case some nodes respond with an older version, the proxy  node will send the latest version to them asynchronously, hence these  left-behind node will still eventually catch up with the latest version.

### **Anti-Entropy data sync**

To ensure the data is still in sync even there is no READ and WRITE occurs to the data, replica nodes periodically gossip with each other to  figure out if anyone out of sync.  For each key range of data, each  member in the replica group compute a Merkel tree (a hash encoding tree  where the difference can be located quickly) and send it to other  neighbors.  By comparing the received Merkel tree with its own tree,  each member can quickly determine which data portion is out of sync. If  so, it will send the diff to the left-behind members.

Anti-entropy is the "catch-all" way to guarantee eventual consistency, but is also  pretty expensive and therefore is not done frequently.  By combining the data sync with read repair and hinted handoff, we can keep the replicas pretty up-to-date.

## **BigTable trade offs**

To  retain the scalability features of BigTable, some of the basic  features  of what RDBMS has provided is missing in the BigTable model.   Here we highlight the rough edges of Bigtable.

**1) Primitive transaction support**
Transaction  protection is only guaranteed within a single row.   In other words,  you cannot start a atomic transaction to modify  multiple rows.

**2) Primitive isolation support**
While  you are reading a row, other people may have modified the same row and  update it before you. Your view is not current anymore but your later  update can easily wipe off other people's change.

There are many  techniques how concurrent update can be isolated,  including pessimistic approach like locking or optimistic approach by  using vector clock to  be the version stamp.  But to the best of my  understanding, there is no robust test-and-set operation in the BigTable  model (this is some  getLock mechanism in Hbase which I haven't looked into), my impression  is that there is no easy  way to check there is no concurrent update  happen in between.

Because  of this limitation, I think BigTable  model is more suitable for those  applications where concurrent update  to the same row is very rare, or  some inconsistency is tolerable at the application level.  Fortunately,  there are still a lot of applications falling into this bucket.

**3) No indexes**
Notice  that data within BigTable are all physically sorted; by rowid, column  name  and timestamp.  There is no index from the column value to  its  containing rowid.

This model is quite different from RDBMS  where you typically define a table and worry about defining the index  later.  There is no such "index" concept in BigTable and you need to   carefully plan out the physical sorting order of your data layout.

Lacking index turns out to be quite inconvenient and many  people using  Bigtable ends up building their own index at the application  level.   This usually results in having a highly denormalized data  model with  lots of column family who store links to other tables.  Any update to  the base data need to carefully update these other column family as  well.  From a performance angle, this is actually better than  maintaining index in RDBMS because Bigtable is optimized from writes.   However, since it is now the application logic to maintain the index,  this can be a source of application bugs.

**4) No referential integrity enforcement**
As mentioned above, since you are building artificial index at the  application level, you need  to maintain the integrity of your index as  well.  This includes update  your index when the base data is inserted,  modified or deleted.  This  kind of handling logic is traditionally  residing at the RDBMS level, but  since BigTable has no such referential integrity concept, this  responsibility is now landed on your  application logic.

**5) Lack of surrounding tools**
As  NOSQL or BigTable is very new, the tools surrounding it is definitely  not comparable to the RDBMS world at this moment, such tools includes   report generation, BI, data warehouse ... etc.

I observe the  general trend that most NOSQL products are moving towards the direction  to provide an ODBC / JDBC interface to integrate with existing tool  markets easier.  But at this  moment, to the best of my understanding,  such interface is not wide spread  yet.


**Design Patterns for Bigtable model
**Due to the very different model of Bigtable, the data model design  methodology is also quite different from traditional RDBMS schema  design.   Here is a sequence of steps that are pretty common ...

**1) Identify all your query scenarios**
Since there is no index concept, you have to plan out carefully how your data is physically sorted.  Therefore it is important to find all your query use cases first.

**2) Define your "entity table" and its corresponding column families**
For an entity table, it is pretty common to have one column family storing all the entity  attributes, and multiple column families to store the links to other  entities.  (e.g. A "UserTable" may contain a column family "baseInfo" to store all attributes of the user, a column family "friend" to store the links to another user, a column family "company" to store links to  another CompanyTable)

**3) Define your "index table"**
The "index table" is what your application build to support reverse lookup.  The "key" is typically base on the search criteria you have identified in your query scenario.  It is not uncommon that each query may have  its own specific index table.

**4) Make sure your application logic updates the index correctly**
Since the index table has to be maintained by application logic, you need to  check to make sure it is done correctly.  In many cases, this can be  quite a source of bugs.

It is important to realize that NOSQL is  not advocating a  searchment of RDBMS which has been proven in many  lines of application.   The NOSQL should be considered a complementary  technologies for some  niche area where RDBMS is not covering well.

**5) Design your update to be idempotent**
[Max's post](http://maxgrinev.com/2010/07/12/update-idempotency-why-it-is-important-in-cassandra-applications-2/) has a good articulation on this.  The basic idea is that due to the  eventual consistency model based on "read/repair" and "quorum update".   It is possible that a failed update is in fact successful.  Here is how  this can happen.

1. Client issue a quorum update.
2. The  server distributed the update to all replica servers, but unfortunately  doesn't get more than half to respond successfully.  So it returns a  failure to the client.
3. Nevertheless, the update has been  received by some minority replicas (in other words, they don't rollback  even the update is not successful).
4. Later, if the client read  one of this minority, it will get this update (even it has failed).   Even more, since this update has a later version, it will read-repair  the other copies (ie: further propagate the failed update).

Therefore, the usual recovery is that user should retry the operation when it  fails.  And the application logic need to deal with potentially  duplicated updates.  One way is to find some way to detect duplications  and ignore them once detected.
