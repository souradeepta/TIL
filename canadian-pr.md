# Understand Canadian permanent resident status

- Permanent residents (PRs) of Canada must carry and present their  valid PR card or permanent resident travel document (PRTD) when boarding a flight to Canada, or travelling to Canada on any other commercial  carrier. If you do not carry your PR card or PRTD, you may not be able  to board your flight, train, bus or boat to Canada.
-  If your PR card expires, it does  not mean you have lost permanent resident status.

## The permanent resident (PR) card

- Your [PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html) can be used to show that you have permanent resident status in Canada.  If you travel outside Canada, you will need to show your card and your passport when you come back on a commercial vehicle, like an airplane,  boat, train or bus.
- PRs traveling outside Canada who do not have a valid PR card, or who are not carrying it, need to apply for a [permanent resident travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html) before returning to Canada by commercial vehicle.

## What permanent residents can do

As a permanent resident, you have the right to:

- get most social benefits that Canadian citizens receive, including health care coverage,
- live, work or study anywhere in Canada,
- apply for [Canadian citizenship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship.html),
- protection under Canadian law and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

You must pay taxes and respect all Canadian laws at the federal, provincial and municipal levels.

## Time Lived in Canada

To keep your permanent resident status, you must have been in Canada for at least **730 days** during the last five years. These 730 days don’t need to be continuous. Some of your time abroad may count towards the 730 days. See what time  abroad counts towards your permanent resident status.

To help you track your time in Canada, use a [travel journal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility/record-trips-outside-canada.html). Other ways to know how long you’ve been in Canada:

- Ask a Canadian border officer when you enter Canada.
- [Apply for or renew your PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html). We will tell you if you’re eligible.

## Losing your permanent resident status

You don’t lose your permanent resident status when your PR  card expires. You can only lose your status if you go through an  official process.

You can lose your permanent resident status if:

- an adjudicator determines you are no longer a permanent resident after an inquiry or PRTD appeal;
- you voluntarily renounce your permanent resident status;
- a removal order is made against you and comes into force; or
- you become a Canadian citizen.

Even if you don't meet the residency obligation, you are still a PR until an official decision is made on your status.

# Six selection factors – Federal Skilled Worker Program (Express Entry)

We use selection factor points to help assess your eligibility for the Federal Skilled Worker Program.

We’ll assess your selection factors and assign an overall score out of 100.

**If you score 67 points or higher**, you may qualify for the Federal Skilled Worker Program.

If you meet the other requirements too, you can submit a profile to  the Express Entry pool. Once you’re in the Express Entry pool, we use a [different system](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system.html) to rank your profile.

**If you score lower than 67 points,** you won’t qualify for the program. You may be able to get a higher score by doing things like:

- improving your language skills
- completing another degree, diploma, or certificate
- receiving an offer of arranged employment in Canada

## Language skills (maximum 28 points)

It’s very important to be able to communicate in 1 or both of  Canada’s official languages. Knowing English, French or both helps you  in the Canadian job market.

You can get up to 28 points for your language skills in English and French. We’ll give you points based on your ability to:

- write
- read
- listen
- speak

### Language testing

You must take **an [approved language test](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements/language-testing.html)** to prove your language levels.

To measure your English or French levels, we use:

- [Canadian Language Benchmarks](http://www.language.ca/resourcesexpertise/on-clb/) (CLB) for English
- [Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) for French](http://www.language.ca/ressourcesexpertise/niveaux-de-competence-linguistique-canadiens/)

You must get a minimum level of **CLB 7 or NCLC 7** for  1 official language in all 4 language areas. To get points for the  second official language, you must meet the minimum level of **CLB 5 or NCLC 5** in all 4 language areas.

Once you take the language test, you can use it to see exactly how many points we’ll give you for the language selection factor.

Find out more about [language testing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements.html) and how to get tested.

### Calculate your language points

#### First official language (maximum 24 points)

Check the table below and add the points that match your skill level:

| First official language | Speaking              | Listening             | Reading               | Writing               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| CLB level 9 or higher   | 6                     | 6                     | 6                     | 6                     |
| CLB level 8             | 5                     | 5                     | 5                     | 5                     |
| CLB level 7             | 4                     | 4                     | 4                     | 4                     |
| Below CLB level 7       | Not eligible to apply | Not eligible to apply | Not eligible to apply | Not eligible to apply |

#### Second official language (maximum 4 points)

You can get 4 points only if you have a score of at least CLB 5 in each of the 4 language abilities.

| Second official language                 | Points |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| At least CLB 5 in all of the 4 abilities | 4      |
| CLB 4 or less in any of the 4 abilities  | 0      |

## Education (maximum 25 points)

If you went to school in Canada, you must have a certificate, diploma or degree from a Canadian:

- secondary institution (high school) or
- post-secondary institution

If you have foreign education, you must have:

- an 

  Educational Credential Assessment (ECA)

   report 

  for immigration purposes

   from a 

  designated organization

   showing that your education is equal to a completed certificate, diploma or degree from a Canadian:

  - secondary institution (high school) or
  - post-secondary institution

You **must** include your Canadian credential or your foreign credential and Educational Credential Assessment report when you apply.

- [How to read your report](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed/read-report.html) and calculate your points for education

## Work experience (maximum 15 points)

You can get points for the number of years you’ve spent doing  full-time paid work (at least 30 hours per week, or an equal amount of  part-time [15 hours per week for 24 months]) at skill type 0, or skill  levels A or B of the 2016 [National Occupational Classification](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html).

To get selection factor points, your work experience will count if it was:

- in Canada or abroad
- while you were studying
- while being self-employed

### Finding your National Occupational Classification (NOC)

The NOC is a list of all the occupations in the Canadian labour  market and is used to classify jobs in the Canadian economy. It  describes duties, skills, talents and work settings for different jobs.

You will need to identify the **“NOC code” for each job that you want to include in your Express Entry profile**. [Find your NOC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html) to find the information that best matches each of your past jobs.

**You’ll need this information again, so make sure to save it.**

If the description and list of main duties match what you did at your job(s), you can count this experience for points.

Use this chart to find the number of points based on your number of years of experience.

| Experience      | Maximum 15 points |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| 1 year          | 9                 |
| 2-3 years       | 11                |
| 4-5 years       | 13                |
| 6 or more years | 15                |

## Age (maximum 12 points)

You’ll get points based on your age on the day we get your application.

| Age          | Points |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Under 18     | 0      |
| 18-35        | 12     |

| 47 and older | 0      |

## Arranged employment in Canada (maximum 10 points)

You can get points if you have a job offer of **at least 1 year** from a Canadian employer. You must get the job offer before you apply to come to Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker.

A [valid job offer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/offer-employment.html) has to be:

# Educational credential assessment (ECA) for Express Entry: How to get one

- No. You don't need ECA for all educational certificates. Only, the  highest one, which is Masters from USA. You get points, based on highest qualification.

   Make sure, you do not mention any other degree/diploma in your Education tab. Many have done it, including me, and received PPR, without any  question.
