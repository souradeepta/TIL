# Spring Boot Tutorial for Beginners (Java Framework)



- start.spring.io for a boilerplate of a project. Select dependencies based on your requirement. Here I select Spring Web Starter
- pom.xml (Project object model) shows the default initializers. Also shows the maven artifacts(refer to java-maven.md) and dependencies
- Set the model as the class request which will be received and then set the DAO as the interface. Use dependency injection to switch between implementations.
