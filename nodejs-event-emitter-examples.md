# Using Event Emitters in Node.js

### Introduction

*Event emitters* are objects in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) that trigger an event by sending a message to signal that an action was completed. [JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript) developers can write code that listens to [events](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-events-in-javascript) from an event emitter, allowing them to execute [functions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-define-functions-in-javascript) every time those events are triggered. In this context, events are composed of an identifying [string](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-strings-in-javascript) and any data that needs to be passed to the listeners.

Typically in Node.js, when we want to have an action occur upon completion of another action, we use [asynchronous programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-asynchronous-code-in-node-js) techniques like nesting callbacks or chaining promises. However, these techniques tightly couple the triggering action and the resulting action, making it difficult to modify the resulting action in the future. Event emitters provide a different way to structure this relationship: the *publish-subscribe* pattern. In this software architecture pattern, a publisher (the event emitter) sends a message (an event), and a subscriber receives the event and performs an action. The power of this pattern is that the publisher does not need to know about the subscribers. A publisher publishes a message, and it’s up to the subscribers to react to it in their respective ways. If we wanted to change the behavior of our application, we could adjust how the subscribers react to the events without having to change the publisher.

In this article, we will create an event listener for a `TicketManager` [JavaScript class](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-classes-in-javascript) that allows a user to buy tickets. We will set up listeners for the `buy` event, which will trigger every time a ticket is bought. This process will also show how to manage erroneous events from the emitter and how to manage event subscribers.



## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your development machine. This tutorial uses version 10.20.1. To install this on macOS or Ubuntu 18.04, follow the steps in [How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment-on-macos) or the **Installing Using a PPA** section of [How To Install Node.js on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04).
- The main example in this article makes use of JavaScript classes as they were introduced in [ES2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) (commonly referred to as ES6). If you’d like to learn about classes in JavaScript, read our [Understanding Classes in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-classes-in-javascript) tutorial.



## Step 1 — Emitting Events

In this step, we’ll explore the two most common ways to create an event emitter in Node.js. The first is to use an event emitter object directly, and the second is to create an object that [extends](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-classes-in-javascript#extending-a-class) the event emitter object.

Deciding which one to use depends on how coupled your events are to the actions of your objects. If the events you want to emit are an effect of an object’s actions, you would likely extend from the event emitter object to have access to its functions for convenience. If the events you want to emit are independent of your business objects or are a result of actions from many business objects, you would instead create an independent event emitter object that’s referenced by your objects.

Let’s begin by creating a standalone, event-emitting object. We’ll begin by creating a folder to store all of our code. In your terminal, make a new folder called `event-emitters`:

```bash
mkdir event-emitters
```

 

Copy

Then enter that folder:

```bash
cd event-emitters
```

 

Copy

Open the first event emitter, `firstEventEmitter.js`, in a text editor. We will use `nano` as it’s available in the terminal:

```bash
nano firstEventEmitter.js
```

 

Copy

In Node.js, we emit events via the `EventEmitter` class. This class is part of the `events` module. Let’s begin by first loading the `events` module in our file by adding the following line:

event-emitters/firstEventEmitter.js

```javascript
const { EventEmitter } = require("events");
```

 

Copy

With the class imported, we can use it to create a new object instance from it:

event-emitters/firstEventEmitter.js

```javascript
const { EventEmitter } = require("events");

const firstEmitter = new EventEmitter();
```

 

Copy

Let’s emit an event by adding the following highlighted line at the end of `firstEventEmitter.js`:

event-emitters/firstEventEmitter.js

```javascript
const { EventEmitter } = require("events");

const firstEmitter = new EventEmitter();


firstEmitter.emit("My first event");
```

 

Copy

The `emit()` function is used to fire events. We need to pass the name of the event to it as a string. We can add any number of arguments after the event name. Events with just a name are fairly limited; the other arguments allow us to send data to our listeners. When we set up our ticket manager, our events will pass data about the purchase when it happens. Keep the name of the event in mind, because event listeners will identify it by this name.

**Note:** While we don’t capture it in this example, the `emit()` function returns `true` if there are listeners for the event. If there are no listeners for an event, it returns `false`.

Let’s run this file to see what happens. Save and exit `nano`, then execute the file with the `node` command:

```bash
node firstEventEmitter.js
```

 

Copy

When the script finishes its execution, you will see no output in the terminal. That’s because we do not log any messages in `firstEventEmitter.js` and there’s nothing that listens to the event that was sent. The event is emitted, but nothing acts on these events.

Let’s work toward seeing a more complete example of publishing, listening to, and acting upon events. We’ll do this by creating a ticket manager example application. The ticket manager will expose a function to buy tickets. When a ticket is bought, an event will be sent with details of the purchaser. Later, we’ll create another Node.js module to simulate an email being sent to the purchaser’s email confirming the purchase.

Let’s begin by creating our ticket manager. It will extend the `EventEmitter` class so that we don’t have to create a separate event emitter object to emit events.

In the same working directory, create and open a new file called `ticketManager.js`:

```bash
nano ticketManager.js
```

 

Copy

As with the first event emitter, we need to import the `EventEmitter` class from the `events` module. Put the following code at the beginning of the file:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");
```

 

Copy

Now, make a new `TicketManager` class that will soon define the method for ticket purchases:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");

class TicketManager extends EventEmitter {}
```

 

Copy

In this case, the `TicketManager` class extends the `EventEmitter` class. This means that the `TicketManager` class inherits the methods and properties of the `EventEmitter` class. This is how it gets access to the `emit()` method.

In our ticket manager, we want to provide the initial supply of tickets that can be purchased. We’ll do this by accepting the initial supply in our [`constructor()`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript#constructor-functions), a special function that’s called when a new object of a class is made. Add the following constructor to the `TicketManager` class:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");

class TicketManager extends EventEmitter {
    constructor(supply) {
        super();
        this.supply = supply;
    }
}
```

 

Copy

The constructor has one `supply` argument. This is a number detailing the initial supply of tickets we can sell. Even though we declared that `TicketManager` is a child class of `EventEmitter`, we still need to call `super()` to get access to the methods and properties of `EventEmitter`. The `super()` function calls the constructor of the parent function, which in this case is `EventEmitter`.

Finally, we create a `supply` property for the object with `this.supply` and give it the value passed in by the constructor.

Now, let’s add a `buy()` method that will be called when a ticket is purchased. This method will decrease the supply by one and emit an event with the purchase data.

Add the `buy()` method as follows:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");

class TicketManager extends EventEmitter {
    constructor(supply) {
        super();
        this.supply = supply;
    }

    buy(email, price) {
        this.supply--;
        this.emit("buy", email, price, Date.now());
    }
}
```

 

Copy

In the `buy()` function, we take the purchaser’s email address and the price they paid for the ticket. We then decrease the supply of tickets by one. We end by emitting a `buy` event. This time, we emit an event with extra data: the email and price that were passed in the function as well as a timestamp of when the purchase was made.

So that our other [Node.js modules](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-node-js-module) can use this class, we need to export it. Add this line at the end of the file:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
...

module.exports = TicketManager
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the file.

We’ve finished our setup for the event emitter `TicketManager`. Now that we’ve put things in place to push events, we can move on to reading and processing those events. To do that, we will create event listeners in the next step.



## Step 2 — Listening for Events

Node.js allows us to add a listener for an event with the `on()` function of an event emitter object. This listens for a particular event name and fires a callback when the event is triggered. Adding a listener typically looks like this:

```javascript
eventEmitter.on(event_name, callback_function) {
    action
}
```

 

Copy

**Note:**: Node.js aliases the `on()` method with `addListener()`. They perform the same task. In this tutorial, we will continue to use `on()`.

Let’s get some first-hand experience with listening to our first event. Create a new file called `firstListener.js`:

```bash
nano firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

As a demonstration of how the `on()` function works, let’s log a simple message upon receiving our first event.

First, let’s import `TicketManager` into our new Node.js module. Add the following code into `firstListener.js`:

event-emitters/firstListener.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");

const ticketManager = new TicketManager(10);
```

 

Copy

Recall that `TicketManager` objects need their initial supply of tickets when created. This is why we pass the `10` argument.

Now let’s add our first Node.js event listener. It will listen to the `buy` event. Add the following highlighted code:

event-emitters/firstListener.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");

const ticketManager = new TicketManager(10);

ticketManager.on("buy", () => {
    console.log("Someone bought a ticket!");
});
```

 

Copy

To add a new listener, we used the `on()` function that’s a part of the `ticketManager` object. The `on()` method is available to all event emitter objects, and since `TicketManager` inherits from the `EventEmitter` class, this method is available on all of the `TicketManager` instance objects.

The second argument to the `on()` method is a callback function, written as an [arrow function](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-define-functions-in-javascript#arrow-functions). The code in this function is run after the event is emitted. In this case, we log `"Someone bought a ticket!"` to the console if a `buy` event is emitted.

Now that we set up a listener, let’s use the `buy()` function so that the event will be emitted. At the end of your file add this:

event-emitters/firstListener.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);
```

 

Copy

This performs the `buy` method with a user email of `test@email.com` and a ticket price of `20`.

Save and exit the file.

Now run this script with `node`:

```bash
node firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

Your console will display this:

```
OutputSomeone bought a ticket!
```

Your first event listener worked. Let’s see what happens if we buy multiple tickets. Re-open your `firstListener.js` in your text editor:

```bash
nano firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

At the end of the file, make another call to the `buy()` function:

event-emitters/firstListener.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the file. Let’s run the script with Node.js to see what happens:

```bash
node firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

Your console will display this:

```
OutputSomeone bought a ticket!
Someone bought a ticket!
```

Since the `buy()` function was called twice, two `buy` events were emitted. Our listener picked up both.

Sometimes we’re only interested in listening to the first time an event was fired, as opposed to all the times it’s emitted. Node.js provides an alternative to `on()` for this case with the `once()` function.

Like `on()`, the `once()` function accepts the event name as its first argument, and a callback function that’s called when the event is fired as its second argument. Under the hood, when the event is emitted and received by a listener that uses `once()`, Node.js automatically removes the listener and then executes the code in the callback function.

Let’s see `once()` in action by editing `firstListener.js`:

```bash
nano firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

At the end of the file, add a new event listener using `once()` like the following highlighted lines:

event-emitters/firstListener.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");

const ticketManager = new TicketManager(10);

ticketManager.on("buy", () => {
        console.log("Someone bought a ticket!");
});

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);

ticketManager.once("buy", () => {
    console.log("This is only called once");
});
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the file and run this program with `node`:

```bash
node firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

The output is the same as the last time:

```
OutputSomeone bought a ticket!
Someone bought a ticket!
```

While we added a new event listener with `once()`, it was added after the `buy` events were emitted. Because of this, the listener didn’t detect these two events. You can’t listen for events that already happened in the past. When you add a listener you can only capture events that come after.

Let’s add a couple more `buy()` function calls so we can confirm that the `once()` listener only reacts one time. Open `firstListener.js` in your text editor like before:

```bash
nano firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

Add the following calls at the end of the file:

event-emitters/firstListener.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.once("buy", () => {
    console.log("This is only called once");
});

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 20);
```

 

Copy

Save and exit, then execute this program:

```bash
node firstListener.js
```

 

Copy

Your output will be:

```
OutputSomeone bought a ticket!
Someone bought a ticket!
Someone bought a ticket!
This is only called once
Someone bought a ticket!
```

The first two lines were from the first two `buy()` calls before the `once()` listener was added. Adding a new event listener does not remove previous ones, so the first event listener we added is still active and logs messages.

Since the event listener with `on()` was declared before the event listener with `once()`, we see `Someone bought a ticket!` before `This is only called once`. These two lines are both responding to the second-to-last `buy` event.

Finally, when the last call to `buy()` was made, the event emitter only had the first listener that was created with `on()`. As mentioned earlier, when an event listener created with `once()` receives an event, it is automatically removed.

Now that we have added event listeners to detect our emitters, we will see how to capture data with those listeners.



## Step 3 — Capturing Event Data

So far, you’ve set up event listeners to react to emitted events. The emitted events also pass along data. Let’s see how we can capture the data that accompanies an event.

We’ll begin by creating some new Node.js modules: an email service and a database service. They’ll be used to simulate sending an email and saving to a database respectively. We’ll then tie them all together with our main Node.js script—`index.js`.

Let’s begin by editing our email service module. Open the file in your text editor:

```bash
nano emailService.js
```

 

Copy

Our email service consists of a class that contains one method—`send()`. This method expects the email that’s emitted along with `buy` events. Add the following code to your file:

event-emitters/emailService.js

```javascript
class EmailService {
    send(email) {
        console.log(`Sending email to ${email}`);
    }
}

module.exports = EmailService
```

 

Copy

This code creates an `EmailService` class that contains a `send()` function. In lieu of sending an actual email, it uses [template literals](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-strings-in-javascript#creating-and-viewing-the-output-of-strings) to log a message to the console that would contain the email address of someone buying a ticket. Save and exit before moving on.

Let’s set up the database service. Open `databaseService.js` with your text editor:

```bash
nano databaseService.js
```

 

Copy

The database service saves our purchase data to a database via its `save()` method. Add the following code to `databaseService.js`:

event-emitters/databaseService.js

```javascript
class DatabaseService {
    save(email, price, timestamp) {
        console.log(`Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (${email}, ${price}, ${timestamp})`);
    }
}

module.exports = DatabaseService
```

 

Copy

This creates a new `DatabaseService` class that contains a single `save()` method. Similar to the email service’s `send()` method, the `save()` function uses the data that accompanies a `buy` event, logging it to the console instead of actually inserting it into a database. This method needs the email of the purchaser, price of the ticket, and the time the ticket was purchased to function. Save and exit the file.

We will use our last file to bring the `TicketManager`, `EmailService`, and `DatabaseService` together. It will set up a listener for the `buy` event and will call the email service’s `send()` function and the database service’s `save()` function.

Open the `index.js` file in your text editor:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

The first thing to do is import the modules we are using:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");
const EmailService = require("./emailService");
const DatabaseService = require("./databaseService");
```

 

Copy

Next, let’s create objects for the classes we imported. We’ll set a low ticket supply of three for this demonstration:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");
const EmailService = require("./emailService");
const DatabaseService = require("./databaseService");

const ticketManager = new TicketManager(3);
const emailService = new EmailService();
const databaseService = new DatabaseService();
```

 

Copy

We can now set up our listener with the instantiated objects. Whenever someone buys a ticket, we want to send them an email as well as saving the data to a database. Add the following listener to your code:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");
const EmailService = require("./emailService");
const DatabaseService = require("./databaseService");

const ticketManager = new TicketManager(3);
const emailService = new EmailService();
const databaseService = new DatabaseService();


ticketManager.on("buy", (email, price, timestamp) => {
    emailService.send(email);
    databaseService.save(email, price, timestamp);
});
```

 

Copy

Like before, we add a listener with the `on()` method. The difference this time is that we have three arguments in our callback function. Each argument corresponds to the data that the event emits. As a reminder, this is the emitter code in the `buy()` function:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
this.emit("buy", email, price, Date.now());
```

 

Copy

In our callback, we first capture the `email` from the emitter, then the `price`, and finally the `Date.now()` data, which we capture as `timestamp`.

When our listener detects a `buy` event, it will call the `send()` function from the `emailService` object as well as the `save()` function from `databaseService`. To test that this setup works, let’s make a call to the `buy()` function at the end of the file:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the editor. Now let’s run this script with `node` and observe what comes next. In your terminal enter:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

You will see the following output:

```
OutputSending email to test@email.com
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email.com, 10, 1588720081832)
```

The data was successfully captured and returned in our callback function. With this knowledge, you can set up listeners for a variety of emitters with different event names and data. However, there are certain nuances to handling error events with event emitters.

Next, let’s look at how to handle error events and what standards we should follow in doing so.



## Step 4 — Handling Error Events

If an event emitter cannot perform its action, it should emit an event to signal that the action failed. In Node.js, the standard way for an event emitter to signal failure is by emitting an *error event*.

An error event must have its name set to `error`. It must also be accompanied by an `Error` object. Let’s see a practical example of emitting an error event.

Our ticket manager decreases the supply by one every time the `buy()` function is called. Right now there’s nothing stopping it from selling more tickets than it has available. Let’s modify the `buy()` function so that if the ticket supply reaches `0` and someone wants to buy a ticket, we emit an error indicating that we’re out of stock.

Open `ticketManager.js` in your text editor once more:

```bash
nano ticketManager.js
```

 

Copy

Now edit the `buy()` function as follows:

event-emitters/ticketManager.js

```javascript
...

buy(email, price) {
    if (this.supply > 0) {
        this.supply—;
        this.emit("buy", email, price, Date.now());
        return;
    }

    this.emit("error", new Error("There are no more tickets left to purchase"));
}
...
```

 

Copy

We’ve added an `if` statement that allows a ticket purchase if our supply is greater than zero. If we don’t have any other tickets, we’ll emit an `error` event. The `error` event is emitted with a new `Error` object that contains a description of why we’re throwing this error.

Save and exit the file. Let’s try to throw this error in our `index.js` file. Right now, we only buy one ticket. We instantiated the `ticketManager` object with three tickets, so we should get an error if we try to buy four tickets.

Edit `index.js` with your text editor:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

Now add the following lines at the end of the file so we can buy four tickets in total:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the editor.

Let’s execute this file to see what happens:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

Your output will be:

```
OutputSending email to test@email.com

    [... lines matching original stack trace ...]
    at internal/main/run_main_module.js:17:47
```

The first three `buy` events were processed correctly, but on the fourth `buy` event our program crashed. Let’s examine the beginning of the error message:

```
Output...
events.js:196
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: There are no more tickets left to purchase
    at TicketManager.buy (/home/sammy/event-emitters/ticketManager.js:16:28)
...
```

The first two lines highlight that an error was thrown. The comment says `"Unhandled 'error' event"`. If an event emitter emits an error and we did not attach a listener for error events, Node.js throws the error and crashes the program.

It’s considered best practice to always listen for `error` events if you’re listening to an event emitter. If you do not set up a listener for errors, your entire application will crash if one is emitted. With an error listener, you can gracefully handle it.

To follow best practices, let’s set up a listener for errors. Re-open the `index.js` file:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

Add a listener before we start buying tickets. Remember, a listener can only respond to events that are emitted after it was added. Insert an error listener like this:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.on("error", (error) => {
    console.error(`Gracefully handling our error: ${error}`);
});

ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
ticketManager.buy("test@email.com", 10);
```

 

Copy

When we receive an error event, we will log it to the console with `console.error()`.

Save and leave `nano`. Re-run the script to see our error event handled correctly:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

This time the following output will be displayed:

```
OutputSending email to test@email.com
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email.com, 10, 1588726293332)
Sending email to test@email.com
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email.com, 10, 1588726293348)
Sending email to test@email.com
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email.com, 10, 1588726293348)
Gracefully handling our error: Error: There are no more tickets left to purchase
```

From the last line, we confirm that our error event is being handled by our second listener, and the Node.js process did not crash.

Now that we’ve covered the concepts of sending and listening to events, let’s look at some additional functionality that can be used to manage event listeners.



## Step 5 — Managing Events Listeners

Event emitters come with some mechanisms to monitor and control how many listeners are subscribed to an event. To get an overview of how many listeners are processing an event, we can use the `listenerCount()` method that’s included in every object.

The `listenerCount()` method accepts one argument: the event name you want the count for. Let’s see it in action in `index.js`.

Open the file with `nano` or your text editor of choice:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

You currently call the `buy()` function four times. Remove those four lines. When you do, add these two new lines so that your entire `index.js` looks like this:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
const TicketManager = require("./ticketManager");
const EmailService = require("./emailService");
const DatabaseService = require("./databaseService");

const ticketManager = new TicketManager(3);
const emailService = new EmailService();
const databaseService = new DatabaseService();

ticketManager.on("buy", (email, price, timestamp) => {
    emailService.send(email);
    databaseService.save(email, price, timestamp);
});

ticketManager.on("error", (error) => {
    console.error(`Gracefully handling our error: ${error}`);
});

console.log(`We have ${ticketManager.listenerCount("buy")} listener(s) for the buy event`);
console.log(`We have ${ticketManager.listenerCount("error")} listener(s) for the error event`);
```

 

Copy

We’ve removed the calls to `buy()` from the previous section and instead logged two lines to the console. The first log statement uses the `listenerCount()` function to display the number of listeners for the `buy()` event. The second log statement shows how many listeners we have for the `error` event.

Save and exit. Now run your script with the `node` command:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

You’ll get this output:

```
OutputWe have 1 listener(s) for the buy event
We have 1 listener(s) for the error event
```

We only used the `on()` function once for the `buy` event and once for the `error` event, so this output matches our expectations.

Next, we’ll use the `listenerCount()` as we remove listeners from an event emitter. We may want to remove event listeners when the period of an event no longer applies. For example, if our ticket manager was being used for a specific concert, as the concert comes to an end you would remove the event listeners.

In Node.js we use the `off()` function to remove event listeners from an event emitter. The `off()` method accepts two arguments: the event name and the function that’s listening to it.

**Note**: Similar to the `on()` function, Node.js aliases the `off()` method with `removeListener()`. They both do the same thing, with the same arguments. In this tutorial, we will continue to use `off()`.

For the second argument of the `off()` function, we need a reference to the callback that’s listening to an event. Therefore, to remove an event listener, its callback must be saved to some variable or constant. As it stands, we cannot remove the current event listeners for `buy` or `error` with the `off()` function.

To see `off()` in action, let’s add a new event listener that we will remove in subsequent calls. First, let’s define the callback in a variable so that we can reference it in `off()` later. Open `index.js` with `nano`:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

At the end of `index.js` add this:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

const onBuy = () => {
    console.log("I will be removed soon");
};
```

 

Copy

Now add another event listener for the `buy` event:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.on("buy", onBuy);
```

 

Copy

To be sure that we successfully added that event listener, let’s print the listener count for `buy` and call the `buy()` function.

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

console.log(`We added a new event listener bringing our total count for the buy event to: ${ticketManager.listenerCount("buy")}`);
ticketManager.buy("test@email", 20);
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the file, then run the program:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

The following message will be displayed in the terminal:

```
OutputWe have 1 listener(s) for the buy event
We have 1 listener(s) for the error event
We added a new event listener bringing our total count for the buy event to: 2
Sending email to test@email
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email, 20, 1588814306693)
I will be removed soon
```

From the output, we see our log statement from when we added the new event listener. We then call the `buy()` function, and both listeners react to it. The first listener sent the email and saved data to the database, and then our second listener printed its message `I will be removed soon` to the screen.

Let’s now use the `off()` function to remove the second event listener. Re-open the file in `nano`:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

Now add the following `off()` call to the end of the file. You will also add a log statement to confirm the number of listeners, and make another call to `buy()`:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.off("buy", onBuy);

console.log(`We now have: ${ticketManager.listenerCount("buy")} listener(s) for the buy event`);
ticketManager.buy("test@email", 20);
```

 

Copy

Note how the `onBuy` variable was used as the second argument of `off()`. Save and exit the file.

Now run this with `node`:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

The previous output will remain unchanged, but this time we will find the new log line we added confirming we have one listener once more. When `buy()` is called again, we will only see the output of the callback used by the first listener:

```
OutputWe have 1 listener(s) for the buy event
We have 1 listener(s) for the error event
We added a new event listener bringing our total count for the buy event to: 2
Sending email to test@email
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email, 20, 1588816352178)
I will be removed soon
We now have: 1 listener(s) for the buy event
Sending email to test@email
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email, 20, 1588816352178)
```

If we wanted to remove all events with `off()`, we could use the `removeAllListeners()` function. This function accepts one argument: the name of the event we want to remove listeners for.

Let’s use this function at the end of the file to take off the first event listener we added for the `buy` event. Open the `index.js` file once more:

```bash
nano index.js
```

 

Copy

You’ll first remove all the listeners with `removeAllListeners()`. You’ll then log a statement with the listener count using the `listenerCount()` function. To confirm it’s no longer listening, you’ll buy another ticket. When the event is emitted, nothing will react to it.

Enter the following code at the end of the file:

event-emitters/index.js

```javascript
...

ticketManager.removeAllListeners("buy");
console.log(`We have ${ticketManager.listenerCount("buy")} listeners for the buy event`);
ticketManager.buy("test@email", 20);
console.log("The last ticket was bought");
```

 

Copy

Save and exit the file.

Now let’s execute our code with the `node` command:

```bash
node index.js
```

 

Copy

Our final output is:

```
We have 1 listener(s) for the buy event
We have 1 listener(s) for the error event
We added a new event listener bringing our total count for the buy event to: 2
Sending email to test@email
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email, 20, 1588817058088)
I will be removed soon
We now have: 1 listener(s) for the buy event
Sending email to test@email
Running query: INSERT INTO orders VALUES (email, price, created) VALUES (test@email, 20, 1588817058088)
We have 0 listeners for the buy event
The last ticket was bought
```

After removing all listeners, we no longer send emails or save to the database for ticket purchases.



## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use Node.js event emitters to trigger events. You emitted events with the `emit()` function of an `EventEmitter` object, then listened to events with the `on()` and `once()` functions to execute code every time the event is triggered. You also added a listener for an error event and monitored and managed listeners with the `listenerCount()` function.

With callbacks and promises, our ticket manager system would need to be integrated with the email and database service modules to get the same functionality. Since we used event emitters, the event was decoupled from the implementations. Furthermore, any module with access to the ticket manager can observe its event and react to it. If you want Node.js modules, internal or external, to observe what’s happening with your object, consider making it an event emitter for scalability.
